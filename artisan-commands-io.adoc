e.g.
[source,php]
public function handle()
{
    $name = $this->ask('What is your name?');
}

[source,php]
->ask('What is your name?') // will show on the bash and wait respond
->secret('What is the password?') // will hide on the bash
->confirm('Do you wish to continue?') // ask to respond 1 or 0
->anticipate('What is your name?', ['Taylor', 'Dayle']) // autocomplete when typing
->choice('What is your name?',['Taylor', 'Dayle'], defaultChoice);
->info('The command was successful!')
->error('Something went wrong!'); // same as info but displayed in red

[source,php]
$users = App\Models\User::all();
$bar = $this->output->createProgressBar(count($users));
$bar->start();
foreach ($users as $user) {
$this->performTask($user);
    $bar->advance();
